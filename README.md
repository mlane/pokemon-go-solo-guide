# Pokémon GO: A Solo Survival Guide

🗓️ **May 2025**  
📍 **Tucson, Arizona**

I'm house-sitting for my parents while they’re off at the Ironman in Hawaii. It’s just me, four poodles (two red toy, two standard), a wildfire (aka Cody Fire) nearby that shut down half the roads, and the echo of the desert in every direction.

![Echo & Ariel – Red Toy Poodles](images/echo-ariel.jpg)  
_Echo’s the one showing off his tail. Ariel’s lurking behind, as usual._

![Baloo – Standard Poodle](images/baloo.jpg)  
_Baloo the guardian. Big heart, big bark, bigger naps._

Somewhere between preparing a talk on emotional AI and caring for dogs in the middle of nowhere, I picked up Pokémon GO again. No gyms. No PokéStops. Just cactus, dust, Froakies... and this oddly perfect feeling that _something here wants to be caught._

So I made this guide.  
For you.  
For me.  
For anyone wandering — geographically or otherwise.

> _“Fast is fine, but accuracy is everything.” — Wyatt Earp_

You’ll want to remember that. Especially out here. Especially when you're playing slow, with no real plan. Accuracy isn't about catching every Pokémon. It's about catching the right ones — the ones that bring you joy. And maybe not stepping on a rattlesnake.

## 🧭 What This Guide _Actually_ Is

- A cheatsheet for minimalists and wanderers
- A philosophy journal in disguise
- A survival guide for when there’s no gym in sight
- A way to remember: you’re allowed to play differently

---

## 🐾 Getting Started When the Closest PokéStop Is a Mirage

- You don’t need to swipe a PokéStop to play
- You don’t need friends or raids or spreadsheets
- You just need one moment — one Froakie, maybe — to feel something

I got to Level 20 without spinning a single stop.  
Just walking. Catching. Thinking.

_Started from scratch. No stops. Just sand, stars, and Froakies._

## 🧼 A Minimalist’s Box Strategy (a.k.a. Don’t Keep 3,000 Pokémon)

Start with 500 storage max. Even 300 is fine.

**Use tags instead of clutter. Your system. Your rules.**

| Tag         | Purpose                                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| ⭐️ PowerUp | High IV or sentimental — might invest later    |
| ❤️ Keep     | No logic. You love them. That's enough         |
| 🧼 Review   | Check later when you're in a clearer headspace |
| ⚔️ PvP      | Good Great League stats or vibes               |
| ⬇️ Transfer | No tag = goodbye. No guilt                     |

I still haven’t swiped a single stop, so I can’t even see IVs yet — and yes, that means I’m Level 20 with **zero app functionality**.  
Call it _desert mode._  
Call it commitment.  
Either way, I’m not transferring anything until I get that first swipe. 😅

## 🔎 IVs & The Tucson Rule

Here’s the truth: you probably won’t get perfect Pokémon out here.  
You’ll get desert warriors. Dust-covered survivors. Froakies with attitude.

So forget the 4-stars.  
Just ask yourself:

- Do I like em?
- Will I use em?
- Is it better than 5 others I already have?

If yes, tag it. If not, let it go. Stardust is gold. Don’t spend it emotionally.

## 🧢 What to Buy (and What to Skip)

You’re solo. Be smart. Be stingy. Be intentional.

| Buy It                               | Skip It                             |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Pokémon Storage (x3)                 | Stickers                            |
| Item Bag Upgrade                     | Avatar clothes (unless roleplaying) |
| Star Piece (for events)              | Lucky Eggs (early game)             |
| Incubators (if walking 5km+ per day) | Lures (unless testing a theory)     |

No shame in buying coins if gyms aren’t nearby.  
Just remember: coins don’t make a journey. Stories do.

## 🧪 Solo IV Philosophy (Tucson Mode)

- 4⭐ = Rare, but not required
- 3⭐ = Great
- 2⭐ = Totally usable
- 1⭐ = Consider transfer unless they’re a _vibe_

The game gives you what it gives you.  
Perfect doesn’t always mean useful. And vice versa.

## 🐉 Building a Dream Team to Strive For

No pressure. No metas. Just love.

- Pick your six
- Stick with them a while
- Rotate when your heart says so

I'm pretty sure Groudon has gotta live in Tucson, right? Sharing my dream team below for fuel to keep me going.

_A vision of the future. No meta, just vibes._

Also, here are some not-Pokémon: I went searching for a Tauros and found real cows.  
That still counts.

![Calf in the Wild](images/calf-in-the-wild.jpg)  
_Wrong Tauros, but she had the stats of a legend. Looked me dead in the eye and kept chewing._

![Chipmunk Lookout](images/squirrel.jpg)  
_False alarm: not a chipmunk, just a desert squirrel cosplaying as Pachirisu.._

![Crow Pair](images/crows.jpg)  
_They’re always together. Not sure what Pokémon they are — maybe Corviknight soulmates._

## 🔋 Bonus Survival Notes

- Catch everything. It’s all Stardust.
- Use berries sparingly. Pinap the ones you want more of.
- Use Incense when walking, or sitting still pretending to be a cactus
- Don’t dump Rare Candy unless you're 100% sure
- Keep Poké Balls. Trust me, you’ll forget to check

## 🌄 Final Thought from a Solo Player

This isn’t just about Pokémon.  
It’s about how you move through the world. Quietly. Intentionally. Maybe without a clear path, but with just enough trust to follow curiosity.

![Tucson Desert Landscape](images/tucson-landscape.jpg)  
_No gyms. No PokéStops. Just space to think, and maybe catch a shadow in the dust._

So if you find yourself out here — literally or emotionally — remember:

- You’re not broken for playing solo
- You’re not late for starting again
- You’re just catching what matters, one Froakie at a time
